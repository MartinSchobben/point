# point

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This projects was originally inspired by the lack of detailed insight in
the inner workings of the default software for the Cameca NanoSIMS50L
(Utrecht University). Hence this project has the objective of processing
raw count data into ion and isotope ratios of point-sourced
measurements, and to establish the internal and external precision of
individual measurements and complete series of measurements,
respectively

## Installation

You can install the released version of point

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("point") -->

<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(point)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
