# point

This projects was originally inspired by the lack of detailed insight in the inner workings of the default software for the Cameca NanoSIMS50L (Utrecht
University). Hence this project has the objective of processing raw count data into ion and isotope ratios of point-sourced measurements, and to establish the
internal and external precision of individual measurements and complete series of measurements, respectively

## Installation

You can install the released version of point 

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("point") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(point)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
