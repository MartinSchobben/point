# Accuracy of Ion Count Data

Systematic bias can be introduced by the way secondary ions are generated from primary Cs^+^ and O^-^ bombardment on the analytical substrate as well as the *ion-to-electron conversion efficiency* in the detection systems. Commonly used detection system are electron multipliers (EM) for low secondary ion currents and Faraday cups (FC) for high secondary ion currents.


## Nomenclature

* Sample: sample of the true population
* Analytical substrate: physical sample measured during SIMS analysis
* Event: single event of an ion hitting the detector
* Measurement: single count cycle $N_i$
* Analysis: $n$-series of measurements $N_{(i)} = M_j$ 
* Study: $m$-series of analyses $M_{(j)}$, constituting the different spots on the analytical substrate

## Analytical bias introduced by electron multipliers

The EM gain is a measure of the electron output current relative to the ion input and the amplification after ion-to-electron conversion. In this process an incident secondary ion triggers the generation of an electron at the first dynode (conversion dynode) of the EM channel; in turn, the resultant secondary electron strikes a consecutive dynode thereby amplifying the signal, where the latter process of secondary electron amplification is repeated multiple times (for the *Cameca NanoSIMS 50L* this generally results in a gain of $10^8$ electrons). 

```{r EMdevice, out.width="80%", echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Graphic representation of the EM ion detection device"}
knitr::include_graphics("EM-channel.png")
```

After this phase of successive cascading charge amplification, the signal is converted to voltage (the EM high voltage, or EMHV; see Fig. \@ref(fig:EMdevice), where the voltage is proportional to the EM gain. This last conversion depends on the age of the EM and the EMHV is usually increased with successive age to preserve ion-to-electron efficiency at a suitable sensitivity. 


### Electron Multiplier Yield

The amplitude of EM secondary electron output to EMHV conversion follows the so-called Peak Height Distribution (PHD). In tuning the EM detection system, the EM secondary electron output to EMHV conversion is optimized so that the probability of an electron output to have a certain EMHV is higher than a pre-defined threshold. This discriminator threshold is set to filter-out the background noise (typically 5$\,$ct$\,$s^-^). However the discriminator threshold will inevitably also cut-off part of the genuine EM secondary electron output [@SLodzian2001].  

```{r PHDcurve, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An example of a typical PHD distribution. The effect of the discriminator threshold on the EM Yield is examplified by the shaded area underneath the probability density function, which would pertain to the probability of an EM output to be larger than the threshold"}

tb.ex <- tibble(PHD = 0:700, 
                lambda = 14,
                prob = 0.93,
                density = dPolyaAeppli(PHD, 
                                       lambda = lambda, 
                                       prob = prob))  
  
ggplot(tb.ex, aes(x = PHD, y = density)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_polygon(data = tb.ex %>% 
                        filter(PHD >= 50) %>% 
                        tibble::add_row(PHD = 50, 
                                        density = 0, 
                                        .before = 1),

This causes the true EM Yield $Y_{EM}$ to be smaller than 100% (see Fig. \@ref(fig:PHDcurve)). The PHD distribution adheres to the following principles:

1) Poisson statistics can account for the random processes involved in the initial generation of secondary ions (coupled to incident ions at the first dynode) and for each stage of successive multiplication by secondary electron generation at subsequent dynodes along the EM channel.
2) A geometric distribution describes the success of amplification at each dynode, which is independent and with identical probabilities at each dynode.
2) Successive stages of electron amplification results in a compounding of these random processes, but the shape of the PHD converges after the fourth or fifth stage of amplification [@Dietz1978].

Given the previous points, the probability of the whole amplification process can be gauged by taking a geometric compounded Poisson (or Polya-Aeppli) random variable [@Dietz1970; @Dietz1978], which can be described by the following equation:

\begin{equation}

  P(x;\lambda, p) \; = \; \text{Pr}(X = x) \; =\\
   \begin{cases}
     e^{-\lambda}, & \text{if } x = 0 \\ 
     e^{-\lambda}\sum_{n=1}^{y}{\frac{\lambda^n}{n!}}\binom{y-1}{n-1}p^{\lambda-n}(1-p)^n, & \text{if } x = 1,2,... \\
   \end{cases}
  (\#eq:PolyaAeppli)

\end{equation}

where $\lambda$ and $p$ determine, respectively, the location and the shape of the Polya-Aeppli probability distribution, see @Burden2014 for a full derivation of this equation and the associated parameters. Note, that the discriminator threshold causes $x > 0$. Furthermore, if $p$ = 0, the Polya-Aeppli probability distribution simplifies to a Poisson distribution. 

The discriminator threshold value, the mean and variance of the measured PHD, can be used to calculate the probability that of successful ion-to-electron conversions before the analysis. This provides a means to get an accurate estimate of the true EM Yield ($Y_{EM}$). 

Th function `cor_yield` calculates the yield with a given mean (`mean_PHD`), standard deviation (`SD_PHD`), and threshold value for the PHD, and makes use of the package `pPolyaAeppli` [@Burden2014].

The $Y_{EM}$ can then be used to calculate the corrected counts and count rates. 

\begin{equation}
  X_{i}^* = \frac{X_i }{Y_{EM}} 
  (\#eq:Yield)
\end{equation}

```{r}
# original count rate of a chemical species
x <- 30000
# function to correct count rate based on EM Yield
cor_yield(x, mean_PHD = 210, SD_PHD = 60, thr_PHD = 50)
```

 
The shape of the PHD distribution changes with the age of the EM but its deleterious effect on secondary ion-to-electron conversion can be alleviated by changing the EMHV. Tools for the assessment of EM deterioration is dealt with in a subsequent section. 

### Dead time

Another bias introduced by EM ion detection devices is the time associated for recovery after an ion hits the first dynode. During the intermediate time, a second ion arriving at the same time can then not be recorded because of the electronic paralysis of the EM. Although this dead time ($t_{ns}$) is small ($44\,$ns), high count frequencies can cause the cumulate effect of this re-occurring phenomenon to become significant for the final count numbers. The count rates can be corrected by the following equation:

\begin{equation}
  X_{i}^{*} = \frac{X_i}{1- X_i  \times t_{ns} \times 10^9}
  (\#eq:Dead)
\end{equation}

The function `cor_DT` is implemented to correct for this systematic bias of EM devices.

```{r}
# corrected count rate for a deadtime of 44 ns
cor_DT(x, 44)
```

For a convenient workflow the functions that correct for EM count biases are wrapped in the function `cor_IC`. This function takes the [tibble](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tibble/vignettes/tibble.html) as loaded with the function `read-IC` (see vignette [IC-read](IC-read.html)) and requires setting the following arguments: `N`, a variable for the raw ion count;`t`, a variable for the time increments; `Det` a character string or variable identifying the ion detection system: EM (`"EM"`) or FC (`"FC"`); `deadtime`, a numeric value for the deadtime in nanoseconds; and `thr_PHD`, a numeric value for the discriminator threshold.


```{r}
# Use point_example() to access the examples bundled with this package 

# Carry-out the routine point workflow 

# Carry-out the routine point workflow
# Raw data containing 13C and 12C counts on carbonate
tb.rw <- read_IC(point_example("2018-01-19-GLENDON"))

# processing raw ion count data
head(cor_IC(tb.rw, N.rw, t.rw, det_type.mt))
```

The function returns the original tibble but adds the variables: `Xt.rw`, ion count rates uncorrected for detection device-specific biases; `Xt.pr`, ion count rates corrected for detection device-specific biases; and `N.pr`, counts corrected for detection device-specific biases. 

<!-- Next in line is another effect which relates to the source of the secondary ions. The efficiency by which an secondary ion is generated can vary dramatically per matrix, element and even isotope. As a result high secondary ion production can result instances where two ion are arriving simultaneously at the EM as the originate from the same primary ion impacting the substrate. Thereby representing a misrepresentation of the counts and skewed isotope values. This is especially relevant for the major ion in isotope analyses as the efficiency of secondary ion generation is higher, and the low probability of QSA becomes higher. This can be corrected by taking the average number of secondary ions ejected per primary ion, or efficiency (secondary ion generated : primary ions) : $K$, and by assuming Poisson statistics dictates the probability of QSA: -->

<!-- $$X_i^{***} = X_i^{**} \times (1+fK)$$ -->

<!-- , where $f$ is 0.5 based on Poisson statistics, BTU has been shown to vary among matrices. At this stage it is hard assess what $K$ could have been. -->

## Analytical bias introduced by Faraday Cups
To be included in the future.


<!-- ## SIMS isotope calibration -->
<!-- Calibration of SIMS isotope measurements .. a twofold; 1) it enables inter-laboratory comparison .. 2) it corrects for isotope fractionation caused during secondary ion production and possibly ... (instrumental mass fractionation).  -->

<!-- ### The instrumental mass fractionation -->

<!-- The instrumental mass fractionation causes the isotopic composition of the ion current and signal registered to be distinctly different from the true isotopic composition of the analytical substrate. To accommodate for this often large discrepancy in the accuracy of SIMS isotope analyses, a standard with a known isotopic value is measured along with the samples of interest. With this standard the unknown isotopic composition of the sample can be calculated as follows: -->

<!-- $$ \delta = \left(\left[\frac{\bar{x}_R}{\bar{x}_{R_{std}}}  \right] \left( \delta_{std} + 1000  \right) \right) -1000 $$ -->

<!-- The isotopic composition of the standard is measured via traditional IRMS and posses it's own analytical uncertainty. Along with the precision achievable with the multiple count cycles of SIMS on the sample and standard this yield a cumulative uncertainty for each sample's isotopic measurement. The standard error of the isotope value that can account for both the SIMS and IRMS precision can be calculated by: -->

<!-- $$ s_{\delta_{\bar{x}}} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{ s_{\bar{x}_{R}} } { \bar{x}_R } \right)^2 + \left( \frac{ s_{\bar{x}_{R_{std}}}  } { \bar{x}_{R_{std}} } \right)^2 + \left( \frac{ s_{\delta_{std}} } { \delta_{std} +1000 } \right)^2} $$ -->







<!-- ## Assessors of analytical drift -->


<!-- As the high counts of the heavy isotope accelerate the age process this effects should be obvious from the isotope rate over time. As such equation is a way to monitor over time: -->

<!-- $$ \delta_t = \frac{R_t - R_{t1}}{R_{t1} }\times 10^3 $$ -->
