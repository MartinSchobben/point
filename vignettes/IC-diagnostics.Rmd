# Diagnostics for Ion Count Data
The random nature of secondary ions emitted from a sample is described by Poisson statistics, which can be used to predict the precision of SIMS measurements under ideal circumstances (e.g., the predicted standard error can be deduced from the total counts of secondary ions). However, besides this fundamental source of imprecision, real SIMS measurements are additionally affected by other factors such as sample heterogeneity, instrument instability, the development and geometry of the sputter pit, and sample charging. Although some of these biases can be avoided by proper instrument tuning and sample documentation (e.g. T/SEM to characterise the textural properties of a rock sample) prior to SIMS measurement, factors such as instrument instability or sample heterogeneity can never be fully eliminated. In this vignette, diagnostic tools are showcased which can help evaluate the potential impact of such factors on the precision of ion count data.

## Nomenclature

* Sample: sample of the true population
* Analytical substrate: Physical sample measured during SIMS analysis
* Event: single event of an ion hitting the detector
* Measurement: single count cycle $N_i$
* Analysis: $n$-series of measurements $N_{(i)} = M_j$ 
* Study: $m$-series of analyses $M_{(j)}$, constituting the different spots on the analytical substrate 

## Isotope ratios: A special case
Isotopes of the same element should have more-or-less the same ionization efficiency [@Fitzsimons2000a]. It thus follows, that in an isotopically homogeneous analytical substrate the count rates of two isotope from the same element should be dependent on each. From this it can be deduced that large deviations in count rate ratios of an isotope system between consecutive measurements indicate a potential discrepancy (e.g., sample heterogeneity and instrument instability).  

## Count block based count optimization (Default Cameca software procedure)
The default method to account for these discrepancies as incorporated in the Cameca software entails a blockwise check for variability. If values fall outside of a pre-defined range of variance (for example two standard deviations; named $\sigma$ in the Cameca software), the measurement will be rejected.

```

Note, that in the above example of the Cameca diagnostics (Fig. \@ref(fig:xcpcameca)), ratios of none-isotope pairs have been calculated.

```{r ion, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="The blockwise mean plotted against consecutive blocks. Note that the non-isotope ratios show a decreasing trend over time.", echo=FALSE}

ggplot(tb.CAMECA, aes(x =`Block#`, y = Mean)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(`Ratio#`), scales = "free") +
  theme_classic()

```


Upon plotting the blockwise mean against the block number (Fig. \@ref(fig:ion)), it becomes apparent that the none-isotope ratios display a monotonic decreasing trend over the duration of the analysis. This effect likely reflects the differential ionization potentials and trajectories of secondary beam stabilization over the analysis.

Based on the Cameca $\sigma$-rejection, it is possible to augment the dataset for each of the analyses by simply removing the anomalous measurements ($N_i$), which pertains to the $N\_rej$ in Fig. \@ref(fig:xcpcameca).

```

However, when comparing the summary statistics of the augmented dataset (Table \@ref(tab:aug)) with the excerpt from the Cameca stat-file (Fig. \@ref(fig:xcpcameca2)) their seems to be a substantial difference. Instead upon comparison with Table \@ref(tab:org), which consist of summary statistics calculated on the original dataset (without $\sigma$-rejection of measurements), the replication is surprisingly consistent. This heralds the question whether there might be a mistake in the Cameca software for calculating statistics on ion ratios for complete analyses. Otherwise the blockwise $\sigma$-rejection of measurements seems rather obfuscated, as it does not seem to serve an obvious purpose.

## Regression diagnostic based count optimization

Precision monitoring by combined predictive and descriptive statistical analysis informs on errors that reflect on a combination of the random nature of secondary ion generation, purely analytical biases and artifacts resulting from the homogeneity of the analytical substrate. What now if we analyse for example a material that has heterogenity in isotope values at smaller sclaes than the beam size. 

The solution seems straightforward, just compare the $R$ values of the individual measurements and see whether they are significantly different at some point during the analysis. However the situation is much more complex as I will illustrate with the following example. For this example I simulated count rates for three types of materials; 1) a substrate with a compeltely homogenous comp[osition "ideal material", 2) a subsrate with a gradient spanning the whole depth of the measurement and 3) a substrate with a sudden offset in isotope composition. In the example the total variation in two heterogenous samples spans 60 per mille, which is large for most naterual systems. Superimposed on this I also imposed a linear trend in the ionization potential, which as discussed before afflicts both isotope speceies in a similar fashion.

              panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent",
                                              color = NA),
              legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent",
                                               color = NA)

In an "ideal" isotopically homogeneous analytical substrate the count rates of two isotope from the same element should be dependent on each other. Thus, even though the ionization efficiency might vary within a single analysis, the count rate of an isotope species $b$ can be deduced from the count rate of isotope species $a$ through a linear combination with the isotope ratio $R$:

\begin{equation}
  E(X_i^b|X_i^a) = RX_i^a \;\;\; \text{where} \;\;\; (X_i^b|X_i^a) \sim P(\lambda)
  (\#eq:conR)
\end{equation}

Variation in this linear count rate relationship is then only caused by the random nature of secondary ion generation, which follows a Poisson distribtuion. If, however, $N_i$ is sufficiently larger for both isotope species, the previous linear combination (Eq. \@ref(eq:conR)) should approximate: 

\begin{equation}
  E(y_i|x_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i \;\;\; \text{where} \;\;\; \epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)
    (\#eq:conmean)
\end{equation}

where, a vector of independent values $x$ and a vector of coefficients ($\beta$) can be used to express the conditional mean of $y$ at any $i$. This formulatiuon is also known as the population linear regression function. Instead of using of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to obtain estimates for the regression coefficients, the $\bar{R}$ can be used as an approximation of $\beta$. Substituting Eq. \@ref(eq:conR) in Eq. \@ref(eq:conmean) suggests that $\hat{\beta}_0$ should approximate $0$:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} = 0
  (\#eq:estB0)
\end{equation}

And thus the following model is adopted

\begin{equation}
  X_i^b = \bar{R}X_i^a + \hat{e}_i \;\;\; \text{where} \;\;\; (\epsilon_i) \sim N(0,\sigma^2)  \;\;\; \text{if} \;\;\; X_i^a, X_i^b >
\end{equation}

The $\epsilon_i$ in Eq. \@ref(eq:conmean) is a random error term consisting of independent and identicaly distributed random variables which originate from a population with a normal distribution. 

```{r normres, eval= FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Quantile-Quantile plot to test normality of residuals",  fig.width=8, fig.height=6}


```

If the $\bar{R}$ of an analysis is derived from an homogenous subtrate, than $\epsilon_i$ should satisfy the following criterion:

\begin{equation}
  E(\epsilon_i|x_i) = 0
  (\#eq:conepsi)
\end{equation}



Given that the ideal situation satifies these conditions, the regression diagnostics on the estimated $\hat{\epsilon}}$ can be used to assess deivations from this "ideal" model. From the previous examples it becomes apparent that even largeky heterogenous substrates cause only minimial deviation in the internal precision. This could be interperted that their is perhaps a lot of hidden variation in the nominal SIMS isotope analysis, which skews $\bar{R}$ but leaves precision untouched.

```{r tableofRandepsilondeviationssimulations}

```


However when comparing large numbers of it can be shown that isotopically heteregenous follow specific trajectories upon comparison of predicted and descriptive statistics. In other words the amount of $N_i$ removed in specific domains will cause a case specific shift.
