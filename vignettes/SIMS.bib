Ratio calculations from ion counts The ion counts (N) that were measured in this study for calculating isotope ratios include 12 C − , 13 C − , 14 N 12 C − , 15 N 12 C − , 12 C − 2 and 13 C 12 C −. These result in the following measured isotope ratio (R m) calculations assuming isobaric interferences (e.g. 12 C 1 H − for 13 C − ; 14 N 13 C − for 15 N 12 C − ; 13 C 2 − , 12 C 13 C 1 H − and 12 C 2 1 H − 2 for 14 N 12 C − ,) are fully resolved. 13 12 R = N (13 C) N (12 C) 25 24 R = N (12 C) {\textperiodcentered} N (13 C) + N (13 C) {\textperiodcentered} N (12 C) N (12 C) 2 = 2 {\textperiodcentered} N (13 C) N (12 C) = 2 {\textperiodcentered} 13 12 R 27 26 R = N (15 N) {\textperiodcentered} N (12 C) + N (12 C) {\textperiodcentered} N (15 N) N (14 N) {\textperiodcentered} N (12 C) + N (12 C) {\textperiodcentered} N (14 N) = N (15 N) N (14 N) = 15 14 R 2. Error from shot noise Even if detection, amplification and signal conversion in isotope ratio measurements were completely free of noise and fractionating effects, there would still be a limit to the maximum attainable precision of isotopic data. This limit is posed by shot noise, a consequence of the discrete nature of electronic charge (whether it is carried by electrons or ions). The statistical error from shot noise is rarely a concern in standard bulk isotope measurements, but due to the low number of ions detected and limited chance for reanalysis from measuring individual cells in secondary ion mass spectrometry, this error estimate provides an important constraint on precision. This is particularly relevant for small analytical targets, in measurements of ions from low abundance elements, ions with low ionization efficiency or with rare minor isotopes. Error from shot noise in ion counts and raw isotope ratios The number of ions N observed at a detector in a fixed time interval t follows a Poisson distribution (i.e., a discrete probability distribution of independent events occurring with an average rate of a). The corresponding probability mass function is f (N) = P (X = N) = (at) N e −at N !. The expected value E[N ] = ¯ N (mean) of a Poisson distribution is ¯ N = at (for a fixed time interval t). The variance V ar[N ] of a Poisson distribution is identical to the expected value, and hence the standard deviation $\sigma$ N scales with the square root of ¯ N ($\sigma$ N = √ V ar[N ] = √ ¯ N). In secondary ion mass spectrometry, analytical targets are typically analyzed in several passes over the same area generating ion images that consist of multiple planes. For small targets and/or low ion currents, individual passes},

Periodic oscillations in the relative yields are similar to those reported for atomic ions at lower impact energies on electron multipliers. A correlation between monoxide ion yields and atomic ion yields has been shown; the monoxide ion of an element has an electron yield which exceeds that of the corresponding atomic ion yield by a constant factor. A similar correlation has been shown for the dimer ions, with a different offset. The effect of using uncorrected signals in some quantitative analysis methods using SIMS is illustrated, showing that as much as 100{\%} error may arise from this source alone. The use of uncorrected monoxide ion signals in these schemes is similarly shown to induce errors caused by the higher monoxide ion yields compared to atomic ions. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {Two petrographic settings of carbonaceous components, mainly filling open fractures and occasionally enclosed in shock-melt veins, were found in the recently fallen Tissint Martian meteorite. The presence in shock-melt veins and the deuterium enrichments (dDupto +1183{\&}) of these components clearly indicate a pristine Martian origin. The carbonaceous components are kerogen-like, based on micro-Raman spectra and multielemental ratios, and were probably deposited from fluids in shock-induced fractures in the parent rock of Tissint. After precipitation of the organic matter, the rock experienced another severe shock event, producing the melt veins that encapsulated a part of the organic matter. The C isotopic compositions of the organic matter (d13C = ?12.8 to ?33.1{\&}) are significantly lighter than Martian atmospheric CO2 and carbonate, providing a tantalizing hint for a possible biotic process. Alternatively, the organic matter could be derived from carbonaceous chondrites, as insoluble organic matter from the latter has similar chemical and isotopic compositions. The presence of organic-rich fluids that infiltrated rocks near the surface of Mars has significant implications for the study of Martian paleoenvironment and perhaps to search for possible ancient biological activities on Mars.

abstract = {The critical role played by first stage gain in shaping the output pulse height distribution and detection efficiency of an electron multiplier used as an ion detector is studied theoretically and experimentally. In a well-focused electron multiplier it is found that anode pulse height distributions observed for different ion species agree well with distributions calculated by using compound Poisson statistics. Models are developed to explain measurement bias in an electron multiplier which is used in either the dc or pulse counting modes and it is shown how these results can be applied to isotope ratio measurements. Design and operating characteristics are described for a 20 stage electron multiplier which was developed for high speed pulse counting and high detection efficiency. The surface of the first dynode is coated with a thin film of Al2O3 to provide a stable first stage yield of 7-9 secondary electrons/incident ion for monatomic alkali ions with 20 kV impact energy. The polyatomic ion Na2BO2+ yields about 16 secondary electrons/incident ion at 20 kV impact energy. Resolving time of the entire detector system is reduced to 10 nsec by using a specially designed solid state discriminator and pulse shaper. Also, a technique is described for the simultaneous detection and pulse counting of two ion beams. {\textcopyright} 1965 The American Institute of Physics.},

Discrimination factors were determined for a series of elements (Pb, Mo, Cu, Ni, Cr, Ti and Si) as metallic targets, using an O2+ primary beam. The results show a trend of isotope ratio, and by inference of the fraction of atoms ionized, proportional to M-0.75. Energy-range selection was used to identify a dependence of the measured isotope ratios on the secondary ion energy, favoring the lighter isotopes, ions of lower energy being more fractionated. A small variation with primary ion energy from 0.5 to 13 ke V was also observed fractionation increasing with decreasing primary beam energy. These effects, together with those due to possible instrumental discrimination, must be taken into account for a complete understanding of isotopic measurements obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Rationale: IMS 7f-GEO isotope ratio applications increasingly involve analyses (e.g., S– or O– isotopes, coupled with primary ion currents {\textless}30 pA) for which quasi-simultaneous arrival (QSA) could compromise precision and accuracy of data. QSA and associated correction have been widely investigated for the CAMECA NanoSIMS instruments, but not for the IMS series. Methods: Sulfur and oxygen isotopic ratio experiments were performed using an electron multiplier (EM) detector, employing Cs+ primary ion currents of 1, 2, 5 and 11.5 pA (nominal) and a variety of secondary ion transmissions to vary QSA probability. An experiment to distinguish between QSA undercounting and purported aperture-related mass fractionation was performed using an EM for 16O– and 18O– plus an additional 16O– measurement using a Faraday cup (FC) detector. An experiment to investigate the accuracy of the QSA correction was performed by comparing S isotopic ratios obtained using an EM with those obtained on the same sample using dual FCs. Results: The QSA effect was observed on the IMS-7f-GEO, and QSA coefficients ($\beta$) of {\~{}}0.66 were determined, in agreement with reported NanoSIMS measurements, but different from the value (0.5) predicted using Poisson statistics. Aperture-related fractionation was not sufficient to explain the difference but uncertainties in primary ion flux measurement could play a role. When QSA corrected, the isotope ratio data obtained using the EM agreed with the dual FC data, within statistical error. Conclusions: QSA undercounting could compromise isotope ratio analyses requiring {\~{}}1 × 105 counts per second for the major isotope and primary currents {\textless}20 pA. The error could be {\textgreater}8‰ for a 1 pA primary current. However, correction can be accurately applied. For instrumental mass fractionation (IMF)-corrected data, the magnitude of the error resulting from not correcting for QSA is dependent on the difference in secondary ion count rate between the unknown and standard analyses.

abstract = {A primary tool of nuclear safeguards authorities for detecting undeclared nuclear activities is environmental sample analysis containing uranium-bearing aerosol particles. SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) has been established as a powerful technique for performing uranium isotope analysis on safeguards samples. Typically, a screening of the sample for locating the particles of interest is followed by micro-beam measurements of individual particles in order to obtain their precise isotopic composition. The uncertainty of these measurements, in particular for the minor isotopes 234U and 236U, is mainly limited by the counting statistics as the total amount of uranium available is very low, usually less than 1 pg. This uncertainty can be reduced when recording several isotopes simultaneously using a multi-collection system. This has been available commercially for many years and has been used for different applications in geosciences on Large Geometry-SIMS (LG-SIMS) instruments. This paper will describe and discuss how isotope measurements of low content uranium materials can be optimized using a multi-ion counting system consisting of five discrete dynode electron multiplier (EM) detectors. The results obtained for uranium isotope ratios are presented for different measurement protocols: static multi-collector, dynamic multi-collector and single collector measurements. Some of the fundamental properties of the detector system that affect the overall measurement uncertainty are discussed. Best practices are also suggested based on the current experience.},

abstract = {Carbonates have variable chemical composition and crystal structure, which can affect the accuracy of in situ (SIMS) isotopic measurements. Carbonate reference materials (calcite, dolomite, ankerite, magnesite, siderite, and rhodochrosite) were characterised for small delta18O by IRMS, and for the chemical composition by electron microprobe, and then used to evaluate the SIMS instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) of oxygen isotopes. A clear relationship between the IMF and the MgO (wt{\%}) content was observed during two different sessions for low Fe- and Mn-carbonates. For Fe- and Mn-bearing carbonates (i.e. more than 1 wt{\%}), Fe and Mn contents have to be taken into account for IMF correction. Due to the highly variable Mg content in carbonates, calibration using suitable carbonate reference materials with different Mg contents (i.e. calcite, dolomite, and magnesite) seems to be the best solution for performing accurate small delta18O measurements by SIMS. This matrix correction is not universally applied. Therefore the overall significance of uncorrected published small delta18O values from high Mg-carbonates has to be taken with caution. There are numerous applications of this method covering domains as varied as environmental studies (stromatolites, high-Mg calcite corals), geothermometry involving calcite co-existing with dolomite, or siderite co-existing with ankerite, and cosmochemical studies of carbonate phases in meteorites.},

abstract = {Analytical precision is vital in the interpretation of stable isotope data collected by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) given the small analysis volumes and the small magnitude of natural isotopic variations. The observed precision of a set of measurements is represented by the standard deviation(precision of an individual measurement) or the standard error of the mean (precision of the mean value). The SIMS data show both systematic variations with time and random Poisson variability, but the former largely cancel out when data for two different isotopes are expressed as a ratio. The precision of a SIMS isotope ratio routinely matches that predicted by Poisson counting statistics and can approach that of conventional bulk analysis techniques for counting times of several hours. All sample analyse must be calibrated for instrumental mass fractionation using SIMS analyses of a standard material. There is often a gradual drift in the mass fractionation with time, but this can be modelled by least-squares regression of the standard isotope ratios. Drift in the sample analyses is eliminated by using the relevant point on this regression line to calibrate each sample. The final precision of a corrected isotope ratio must take into account the scatter in both the sample and the standard data.},

Because there is typically a greater abundance of235U16O+ and238U16O+ molecular secondary ions than235U+ and238U+ atomic ions when uranium-bearing materials are sputtered with an oxygen primary ion beam, the goal was to understand whether use of235U16O/238U16O has the potential for improved accuracy and precision when compared to the235U/238U ratio. The UO2 and silicate reference materials showed the greatest potential for improved accuracy and precision through use of the235U16O/238U16O ratio as compared to the235U/238U ratio. For the UO2, which was investigated at a variety of primary beam currents, and the silicate reference materials, which were only investigated using a single primary beam current, this improvement was especially pronounced at low235U+ count rates. In contrast, comparison of the235U16O/238U16O ratio versus the235U/238U ratio from the other uranium compounds clearly indicates that the235U16O/238U16O ratio results in worse precision and accuracy. This behavior is based on the observation that the atomic (235U+ and238U+) to molecular (235U16O+ and238U16O+) secondary ion production rates remain internally consistent within the UO2 and silicate reference materials, whereas it is highly variable in the other uranium compounds. Efforts to understand the origin of this behavior suggest that irregular sample surface topography, and/or molecular interferences arising from the manner in which the UO2F2, UO3, UO2(NO3)2{\textperiodcentered}6(H2O), and UF4 were prepared, may be a major contributing factor to the inconsistent relationship between the observed atomic and molecular secondary ion yields. Overall, the results suggest that for certain bulk compositions, use of the235U16O/238U16O may be a viable approach to improving the precision and accuracy in situations where a relatively low235U+ count rate is expected.},

abstract = {This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art of isotope amount ratio measurements by solution-based multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC ICP-MS) and presents guidelines for corresponding data reduction strategies and uncertainty assessments based on the example of n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) isotope ratios. This ratio shows variation attributable to natural radiogenic processes and mass-dependent fractionation. The applied calibration strategies can display these differences. In addition, a proper statement of uncertainty of measurement, including all relevant influence quantities, is a metrological prerequisite. A detailed instructive procedure for the calculation of combined uncertainties is presented for Sr isotope amount ratios using three different strategies of correction for instrumental isotopic fractionation (IIF): traditional internal correction, standard-sample bracketing, and a combination of both, using Zr as internal standard. Uncertainties are quantified by means of a Kragten spreadsheet approach, including the consideration of correlations between individual input parameters to the model equation. The resulting uncertainties are compared with uncertainties obtained from the partial derivatives approach and Monte Carlo propagation of distributions. We obtain relative expanded uncertainties (U rel; k = 2) of n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) of {\textless} 0.03 {\%}, when normalization values are not propagated. A comprehensive propagation, including certified values and the internal normalization ratio in nature, increases relative expanded uncertainties by about factor two and the correction for IIF becomes the major contributor.},

abstract = {A general-purpose ion detector has been developed for fast pulse counting in mass spectrometry. It consists of a six-stage electron multiplier joined to part of a scintillator detector. This novel arrangement combines the virtually noiseless pulse-amplification response of an electron multiplier with the bipolar voltage flexibility of a scintillator detector. The resulting hybrid detector is superior in performance to either an electron multiplier or a conventional scintillator detector. It is designed to detect a beam of positive ions or negative ions focused to a line image or to a spot at the focal plane of a mass analyzer. Background counting noise is less than 1 count/min when the detector is used in either the positive ion or negative ion detecting mode. Mass-resolved ions are post-accelerated through an electric field to give them an additional kinetic energy of 10 keV before they strike the ion-to-electron converter in the electron multiplier. This allows low-energy ions to be detected with an efficiency close to unity, over a range of ion masses from 1 amu up to several hundred amu. Randomly spaced pulses can be counted at rates from 0 Hz to 10 MHz. The design of the detector and its operating characteristics are discussed.},

abstract = {Ion microprobe measurements of D/H ratios in individual fragments of eight stratospheric dust particles give $\delta$D values ranging from -386 to +2534‰ relative to SMOW. The $\delta$D values in five particles far exceed those in terrestrial samples and prove that the samples are interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). The hydrogen isotopic composition is heterogeneous on a scale of a few microns demonstrating that the dust is unequilibrated. Measurements of D/H ratios in conjunction with elemental and molecular ion signals in different fragments of individual IDPs show that a carbonaceous phase, not water, is the carrier of the D enrichments. Previous infrared transmission measurements have shown that IDPs fall into three main spectral classes. Particles from two of those three IR classes show large D/H ratios. Two particles studied from the third class do not. However, one of these contains solar flare tracks and is extraterrestrial. Thus, most, but not all, IDPs contain hydrogen with a non-terrestrial isotopic composition. Carbon isotopic measurements on fragments of three IDPs give ratios similar to terrestrial values and show a largely uniform isotopic composition for a given particle. Small, but significant, differences in $\delta$13C of {\~{}}40‰ between particles are seen. No correlations between the hydrogen and carbon isotopic compositions are observed. The magnesium and silicon isotopic compositions of fragments of three IDPs are found to be normal within measurement errors. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

The spectra are obtained by stepping the sample accelerating potential by small voltage steps and determining the detector pulse count rate at each energy. The computer program controls the sample potential, collects the data, makes corrections for ion optical and geometric effects, calculates several important parameters of the energy distribution, and outputs the corrected and uncorrected results to line printer and a plotter. The system is fast, accurate, and very easy to operate.

abstract = {The D/H ratio imaging of weakly hydrated minerals prepared as focused ion beam (FIB) sections is developed in order to combine isotopic imaging by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) of micrometer-sized grains with other nanoscale imaging techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy. In order to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and reproducibility of D/H ratios at the micrometer size, while minimizing the surface contamination at the same time, we explored all instrumental parameters known to influence the measurement of D/H ratios in situ. Optimal conditions were found to be obtained with the use of (i) a Cs+ ion source and detection of H- and D- at low mass resolving power, (ii) a primary beam intensity of 100 pA, and (iii) raster sizes in the range of 8-15 $\mu$m. Nominally anhydrous minerals were used to evaluate the detection limits and indicate a surface contamination level of ∼200 ppm equivalent H2O under these conditions. With the high primary intensity used here, the dwell time is not a parameter as critical as found in previous studies and a dwell time of 1 ms/px is used to minimize dynamic contamination during analysis. Analysis of FIB sections was found to reduce significantly static contamination due to sample preparation and improved accuracy compared to using polished sections embedded not only in epoxy but in indium as well. On amphiboles, the typical overall uncertainty including reproducibility is ∼20 ‰ on bulk FIB sections and ∼50 ‰ at the 1.5 $\mu$m scale using image processing (1$\sigma$).},
