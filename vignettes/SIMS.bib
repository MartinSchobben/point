abstract = {From the perspective of political science, the first question that arises when one looks at the concept of “smartness” is whether it has a political dimension. This chapter intends to answer this question in a positive sense and helps to analyze forms and contents of such political dimension in Western countries. The main thesis is that an “implicit smart politics” exists. This type of politics is often not identifiable as such, not subjected to a real process of political institutionalization, and strongly diffused among the various social actors. Moreover, we affirm that the ‘implicit' character of the smart politics is intertwined with the great changes of modern politics caused by the processes of globalization and by the transformations of the role and meaning of the modern state. Thereafter, this chapter discusses the central risks of the implicit smart politics, whose lack of institutionalization in genuinely democratic political forums may favor the excessive power of economic-financial and technological actors. In the final analysis, we argue for an overall political vision and a long-term political project, which guarantees the recognition and limitability of power and defines the forms of political and democratic participation.},

@article{Dietz1978,
abstract = {A general-purpose ion detector has been developed for fast pulse counting in mass spectrometry. It consists of a six-stage electron multiplier joined to part of a scintillator detector. This novel arrangement combines the virtually noiseless pulse-amplification response of an electron multiplier with the bipolar voltage flexibility of a scintillator detector. The resulting hybrid detector is superior in performance to either an electron multiplier or a conventional scintillator detector. It is designed to detect a beam of positive ions or negative ions focused to a line image or to a spot at the focal plane of a mass analyzer. Background counting noise is less than 1 count/min when the detector is used in either the positive ion or negative ion detecting mode. Mass-resolved ions are post-accelerated through an electric field to give them an additional kinetic energy of 10 keV before they strike the ion-to-electron converter in the electron multiplier. This allows low-energy ions to be detected with an efficiency close to unity, over a range of ion masses from 1 amu up to several hundred amu. Randomly spaced pulses can be counted at rates from 0 Hz to 10 MHz. The design of the detector and its operating characteristics are discussed.},

abstract = {A general method is given for computing output pulse-height distributions for a wide variety of multistage pulse-counting detectors used in mass spectrometry and in scintillation spectrometry. Calculations are simple, mathematically accurate and require minimum computer time. Conditional probabilities and convolutions of generating functions are used to describe electron multiplication statistics at each stage of charge amplification. Among the detectors which can be analyzed are electron multipliers, photomultipliers, scintillation detectors, and the combination of an ion-converter dynode with a silicon semiconductor detector as it is used in diagnostic studies of secondary electron emission. Examples are given of theoretical fits to experimental data. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

abstract = {The critical role played by first stage gain in shaping the output pulse height distribution and detection efficiency of an electron multiplier used as an ion detector is studied theoretically and experimentally. In a well-focused electron multiplier it is found that anode pulse height distributions observed for different ion species agree well with distributions calculated by using compound Poisson statistics. Models are developed to explain measurement bias in an electron multiplier which is used in either the dc or pulse counting modes and it is shown how these results can be applied to isotope ratio measurements. Design and operating characteristics are described for a 20 stage electron multiplier which was developed for high speed pulse counting and high detection efficiency. The surface of the first dynode is coated with a thin film of Al2O3 to provide a stable first stage yield of 7-9 secondary electrons/incident ion for monatomic alkali ions with 20 kV impact energy. The polyatomic ion Na2BO2+ yields about 16 secondary electrons/incident ion at 20 kV impact energy. Resolving time of the entire detector system is reduced to 10 nsec by using a specially designed solid state discriminator and pulse shaper. Also, a technique is described for the simultaneous detection and pulse counting of two ion beams. {\textcopyright} 1965 The American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Fitzsimons2000a,
abstract = {Analytical precision is vital in the interpretation of stable isotope data collected by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) given the small analysis volumes and the small magnitude of natural isotopic variations. The observed precision of a set of measurements is represented by the standard deviation(precision of an individual measurement) or the standard error of the mean (precision of the mean value). The SIMS data show both systematic variations with time and random Poisson variability, but the former largely cancel out when data for two different isotopes are expressed as a ratio. The precision of a SIMS isotope ratio routinely matches that predicted by Poisson counting statistics and can approach that of conventional bulk analysis techniques for counting times of several hours. All sample analyse must be calibrated for instrumental mass fractionation using SIMS analyses of a standard material. There is often a gradual drift in the mass fractionation with time, but this can be modelled by least-squares regression of the standard isotope ratios. Drift in the sample analyses is eliminated by using the relevant point on this regression line to calibrate each sample. The final precision of a corrected isotope ratio must take into account the scatter in both the sample and the standard data.},
